1. Majority of the ideas in idea_evaluation by humans was not in llama_researcher,
   meaning that the idea.json/relatedness portion did not catch everything

2. the AI NEVER recorded "Highly related" and barely did "Not related" (wants to stay "safe")

3. agreement matrix seems like pretty weak relation for human 4.0 proficiency & llama_researcher
